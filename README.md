# vpn-idp

This repository includes a VPN solution based on WireGuard that implements user authentication using OAuth2.0 and IdPs. The solution was proposed in my MSc thesis:

- D. Mortágua, "Authentication in VPNs and 802.1X networks with Identity Providers," M.S. thesis, Department of Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, 2023. [Online]. Available: soon

A PDF containing the dissertation presentation is present in both modules.
