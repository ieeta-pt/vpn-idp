# vpn-idp

This repository includes a VPN solution based on WireGuard that implements user authentication using OAuth2.0 and IdPs. The solution was proposed in my MSc thesis:

- D. Mortágua, "Authentication in VPNs and 802.1X networks with Identity Providers," M.S. thesis, Department of Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, 2023. [Online]. Available: soon

A PDF containing the dissertation presentation is present in both modules.

This work was also presented at The Nineteenth International Conference on Networking and Services (ICNS 2023).
The article PDF is available [here](https://www.thinkmind.org/articles/icns_2023_1_30_10016.pdf).
